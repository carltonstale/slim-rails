# slim-rails

slim-rails provides Slim generators for Rails 3. It was based on [haml-rails](http://http://github.com/indirect/haml-rails) and it does basically the same: configures Slim as the template engine automatically for your rails app.
To use it, add this line to your Gemfile:

    gem "slim-rails"

And that's it.
Every time you generate a controller or scaffold, you'll get Slim templates.
